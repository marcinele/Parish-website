# Overview
Website for the use of local parish created for the project for "WWW and Script Languages" subject on AGH UST.
<br>
Whole project was made from the scratch, except for the date and time picker (can be seen on the /reseravtions page). 
We used javascript library created by [**Amsul**](https://github.com/amsul). (https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js). 

# Main features
### Admin panel
Website supports full CRUD for parish announcements (only for admin). <br> Admin can also add new mass to the calendar.
<br>
### Reservations
Reservation page gives a logged user an option to reserve a place in the church for the previously chosen mass.
### Donate
User can donate the church with any amount of money using cryptocurrencies.

Website can be found [here](https://s103.labagh.pl/). If the link doesn't work, check [directory]() with screenshots 
that we prepared.
