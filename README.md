# Overview
Website for the use of local parish created for the project for "WWW and Script Languages" subject on AGH UST.
<br>
The whole project was made from the scratch, except for the date and time pickers (can be seen on the /reservations page). 
We used javascript library created by [**Amsul**](https://github.com/amsul). (https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js). 

# Main features
### Admin panel
Website supports full CRUD for parish announcements (only for admin). <br> Admin can also add a new mass to the calendar.
<br>
### Seat reservations (COVID edition)
Reservation page gives a logged user an option to reserve a seat in the church for the previously chosen mass. <br> <br>

User can check the box if he was vaccinated twice, which let him choose the seats that were blocked due to the COVID restrictions. <br> <br>

If you want to check this feature yourself, go into the /reservations and pick **3rd of October** - there are some masses added by the admin. 
### Donate
User can donate the church with any amount of money using cryptocurrencies.
